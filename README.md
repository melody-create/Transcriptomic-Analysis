# Transcriptomic-Analysis
SLURM bash scripts to analyze RNA-seq data and R scripts to visualize RNA-seq data.
Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from pooled n = ~30-50 Danio Rerio (zebrafish) larva Wild-Type, chd7 heterozygous, and chd7 homozygous mutant head tissue at two developmental time points 3 days post fertilization (dpf) and 5 dpf with the goal of finding genetic targets of CHD7.
